Apuê: Remote Science Lab Platform
==============

Apuê is a Sakai (https://sakaiproject.org/) tool meant for experimental science students and teachers. By providing a web interface it allows students to interactively have remote lab classes. Teachers can setup lab experiments and integrate them with the platform using Arduino as the hardware controller. Afterwards students can be grouped and schedule lab classes.
